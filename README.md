We used Claude AI to figure out how to scale the background videos as seen on the website pages and centering / continual video editing. In addition to the home page we used Chat-GPT to add the glow effect in the word ‘Star’ in Hello Stargazers.

Google Fonts were used in order to display the unique fonts for the Title and subheadings, using Exo 2 font. Not only the fonts, but also the main logo was generated by AI and the unique buttons and and login panel was taken from universe.io 

In order for the login to work (in-progress), we coded a mongo DB atlas database to store their information as a plan to integrate into our project, to take 

For the constellation map, Claude was used to generate all of the data as we could not find a suitable API. We also used chat gpt to help us debug and to help us with the CSS. 

We used ChatGPT and Claude AI for few implementations of Mapbox API in Javascript. Since we did not have much experience in coding in Javascript and CSS we started with learning some basic concepts from ChatGPT like how to implement basic initialized user location in JavaScript. Also used Claude to understand how to fetch data and create markers for the locations in the radius.

Our background videos were from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N29RvAV_bk and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tdpyu2XSt2c
